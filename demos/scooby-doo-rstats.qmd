## data from TidyTuesday: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-13/readme.md

library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)
scooby_raw <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-07-13/scoobydoo.csv')

## The MLOps cycle

![MLOps cycle](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/images/ml_ops_cycle.png)

Data scientists have effective tools that they ❤️ to:

-   collect data

-   prepare, manipulate, refine data

-   train models

There is a lack 😩 of effective tools (especially open source) to:

-   put models into production

-   monitor model performance

-   trigger retraining

## What is vetiver? <https://vetiver.rstudio.com/>

> *Vetiver, the oil of tranquility, is used as a stabilizing ingredient in perfumery to preserve more volatile fragrances.*

The **goal** of vetiver is to provide fluent tooling to **version, deploy, and monitor** a trained model.


## Build a model

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)
scooby <- read_feather("scooby-do.arrow")

scooby
```

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
tree_spec <- decision_tree(tree_depth = 10, min_n = 2, mode = "classification")
tree_form <- monster_real ~ year_aired + imdb
tree_fit <-
  workflow(tree_form, tree_spec) %>%
  fit(scooby)

tree_fit
```

Data scientists use tools they love for these steps, like the tidyverse, pandas, tidymodels, scikit-learn, etc.

## Version and deploy a model

Create a deployable model object:

```{r}
library(vetiver)
v <- vetiver_model(tree_fit, "scooby-doo")
v
```

Version and share the model:

```{r}
library(pins)
model_board <- board_rsconnect() ## also support board_s3(), board_azure(), etc
model_board %>% vetiver_pin_write(v)
```

Document the model: <https://vetiver.rstudio.com/learn-more/model-card.html>

Deploy model as a REST API:

```{r}
library(plumber)
pr() %>%
  vetiver_api(v, debug = TRUE) %>%
  pr_run()
```

- Deploy to Connect: <https://rstudio.github.io/vetiver-r/dev/reference/vetiver_deploy_rsconnect.html>

- Deploy via Docker (after creating plumber file via `vetiver_write_plumber(model_board, "julia.silge/scooby-doo")`):

```{r}
#| eval: false
vetiver_write_docker(v)
```

## Predict from a model

Predict for remote vetiver model:

```{r}
scooby_endpoint <- vetiver_endpoint("http://127.0.0.1:8080/predict")
scooby_endpoint
```

```{r}
new_episodes <- tidyr::crossing(
  year_aired = seq(1970, 2000, by = 10),
  imdb = seq(5, 9, by = 0.5)
)
new_episodes
```

```{r}
predict(scooby_endpoint, new_episodes)
```
