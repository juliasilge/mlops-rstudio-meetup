Many data scientists understand what goes into training a machine learning model, but creating a strategy to deploy and maintain that model can be daunting. In this meetup, learn what MLOps is, what principles can be used to create a practical MLOps strategy, and what kinds of tasks and components are involved. See how to get started with vetiver, a framework for MLOps tasks in R and Python that provides fluent tooling to version, deploy, and monitor your models.
